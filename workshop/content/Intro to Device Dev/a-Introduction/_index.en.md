IoT provides a way to monitor, control, and collect information about your physical world. 

>AWS IoT makes it easy for you to build scalable IoT applications that collect, process, analyze, and act on data generated by connected home devices without having to manage any infrastructure. This helps you focus on building solutions and experiences that deliver value to both your businesses and your consumers and create a new class of connected home applications that interact with the physical world.
