> why it's important



>  the students want to use the Core2 for AWS to learn more about embedded engineering, and need to learn foundational concepts before writing apps for the device.

> course objectives: 

> by the end of this course the students will: 

> * describe the purpose and benefits to using iot in a solution
> * describe build system components; such as, (CMake), compilers (GCC), toolchains, board support packages, and software libraries (IoT C-SDK).
> * describe where the BSP is located and how to enable/disable features, where the API reference is located and how to utilize the APIs for their apps.
> * describe RTOS tasks and why is an RTOS valuable in a connected embedded application.
> * describe RTOS task controls; such as, Queues, Mutexes, Semaphores, and Event Groups.
> * modify, compile, upload, and run a pre-written blinky application.
