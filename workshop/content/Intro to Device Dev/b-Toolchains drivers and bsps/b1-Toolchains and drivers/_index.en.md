The {{< awsService type="edukit-long-en" >}} development kit consists of a development board, microcontroller (MCU), memory, input and output pins, and an interface for communication. In order to program, or provide instructions, to the {{< awsService type="edukit-short-en" >}} you must supply firmware. A toolchain consists of programming tools that help you develop and communicate firmware to your board. 

Toolchains can contain different tools, but commonly consist of a build system, cross compiler, board support packages (BSP), and software libraries. 
#### Build system ###

(CMake)



For more information, see [About CMake](https://cmake.org/overview/).



#### Cross compiler ###

(GCC)
A cross compiler translates the written code into executable code for the development board's processor. In our case, we're creating C programs and using the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) 


For more information, see [GCC, the GNU Compiler Collection](https://gcc.gnu.org/) through GNU.org and [GNU Compiler Collection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Compiler_Collection) on Wikipedia. 

#### Board support packages ###


(BSP, or hardware drivers)


For more information, see [Core2 for AWS IoT EduKit BSP](https://edukit.workshop.aws/en/api-reference/index.html).


#### Software libraries ###


(IoT C-SDK) to create MCU applications
