For clarity, let's begin by defining the commonly misunderstood terms: authentication and authorization. *Authentication* is the process of identifying a device and, potentially, providing the required credentials to gain access. *Authorization* provides permissions about what functions that device can perform or access while they have access. 

This process is very similar to visiting an office. You arrive at the building and approach the security desk. They ask you to prove your identity and determines whether you should gain access to the building (authentication). If approved, they commonly give you a badge that you scan to enter the main area, different floors, and special rooms (authorization).

If you try to gain access to a floor that is restricted, the door may remain locked. If you attempt to access a highly sensitive area, however, it may trigger a warning and your day quickly becomes more complicated. 

This lesson discusses introductory authentication and authorization concepts (such as transport layer security, X.509 certificates, and IoT policies).
