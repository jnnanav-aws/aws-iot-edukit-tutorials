Let's begin by defining the commonly misunderstood terms: authentication and authorization. *Authentication* is a mutual process where the server identifies the device and the device identifies the server; potentially, providing the required credentials to allow access. *Authorization* provides permissions about what functions that device can perform or access while they have access. 

This process is very similar to visiting an office. You arrive at the building and qualify that you're in the right place by verifying the address and confirming visual queues; such as, corporate logos and surrounding information. When you enter the building, you approach the security desk. They ask you to prove your identity and determine whether you should gain access to the building (authentication). If approved, you commonly receive a badge that you scan to enter the main area, different floors, and special rooms (authorization).

If you try to gain access to a floor that you aren't allowed to access, the door may remain locked. If you attempt to access a highly sensitive area, however, it may trigger a warning and your day quickly becomes more complicated. 

This lesson discusses introductory authentication and authorization concepts (such as transport layer security, X.509 certificates, and IoT policies).
