For clarity, let's begin by defining the commonly misunderstood terms: authentication and authorization. *Authentication* is the process of identifying a device and, potentially, providing the required credentials to gain access. *Authorization* provides permissions about what functions that device can perform or access while they have access. 

This lesson discusses introductory authentication and authorization concepts (such as transport layer security, X.509 certificates, and IoT policies).
