### Introduction to transport layer security ###

Transport layer security (TLS) is a cryptographic protocol that is designed to provide communications security over a computer network. TLS ensures that application protocols remain confidential. TLS support is available in a number of programming languages and operating systems. 

For MQTT communication, TLS encrypts the connection between the device and the message broker. 


### X.509 certificates ###

X.509 is a standard that defines public key infrastructure where the public key is associated with an identity contained within a certificate. X.509 certificates can be issued by a trusted entity called a certificate authority (CA) or they can be self-signed. A CA maintains one or more special certificates called CA certificates that it uses to issue X.509 certificates. Only the CA has access to the private key of the CA certificate.

AWS requires a client certificate must be registered with AWS IoT before a client can communicate with AWS IoT. For more information, see AWS documentation: [X.509 client certificates](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/x509-client-certs.html).
