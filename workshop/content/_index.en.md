AWS IoT EduKit is an easy way to learn how to build IoT applications using AWS services through a prescriptive learning program. 
Students, engineers, and professionals benefit from hands on practice with the AWS IoT EduKit. These educational resources combine a reference hardware kit with detailed guides and code examples to build IoT applications.

### Benefits of AWS IoT EduKit
#### Simplified hardware selection
- AWS IoT EduKit’s reference hardware kit is made and sold by our manufacturing partner, M5Stack, and packed with onboard features so that you can easily create IoT applications straight out of the box. Developers can broaden the device's capabilities and cover additional use-cases with plug and play expansion options.
- The reference hardware kit provides powerful and secure hardware to build a range of IoT applications at an affordable price tag. The AWS IoT EduKit is powered by an Espressif ESP32 microcontroller unit (MCU), coupled with a Microchip ATECC608 Trust&GO secure element. It is Alexa capable and comes with multiple on-board peripherals. There are a wide range of expansion modules that are sold separately to provide additional connectivity (such as, LoRaWAN, NB-IoT, LTE). There are also plug and play grove-connector peripherals (such as, sensors and actuators) to cover a wider breadth of use-cases.

#### Supports a wide range of software frameworks
- AWS IoT EduKit’s reference hardware supports a wide range of application frameworks (e.g. FreeRTOS, Arduino, MicroPython) which allows developers to code in the language of their choice and progress in building cloud connected embedded applications on a single hardware platform.
- AWS IoT EduKit simplifies on-boarding to AWS IoT through through Espressif's ESP RainMaker platform and PlatformIO development platform. The ESP RainMaker platform allows you to control the reference hardware kit and control the smart home application without an AWS account. The PlatformIO development platform simplifies embedded development to quickly view, edit, and flash code.

#### Easy access to Sample Code
- AWS IoT EduKit provides up-to-date content and example code to the most common IoT solutions.
- Through AWS IoT EduKit [tutorials](https://edukit.workshop.aws/en/getting-started.html), developers can access a variety of free content to gain expertise in building and managing IoT applications using AWS services.

### How it works
To get started, purchase your reference hardware kit from [Amazon.com](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08VGRZYJR/) (US), [M5Stack store](https://m5stack.com/products/m5stack-core2-esp32-iot-development-kit-for-aws-iot-edukit) (CN/Global), [Digi-Key](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/m5stack-technology-co-ltd/K010-AWS/13562927) (AMER/Global), [Mouser Electronics](https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/M5Stack/K010-AWS?qs=%2Fha2pyFaduh2vnlTOLWOXVDYhV94RvwKuua4BUEreQw%3D) (AMER/Global), [Switch Science](https://www.switch-science.com/catalog/6784/) (JP), or [Distrelec](https://www.distrelec.biz/en/esp32-m5core2-iot-development-kit-for-aws-iot-edukit-m5stack-k010-aws/p/30196462) (EU).

Once you receive the hardware kit, access the [getting started tutorial](https://edukit.workshop.aws/en/getting-started.html) and follow the steps in the prerequisite section to install the ESP RainMaker Agent firmware on the device and the ESP RainMaker Mobile App on your mobile phone. The ESP RainMaker Mobile App will allow you to control the AWS IoT EduKit reference hardware and connect to AWS IoT. Next, you can select from a list of free projects available on AWS IoT EduKit's website. Start with building a basic connected home application and progress over time to running a machine learning model with Amazon SageMaker Autopilot or building a Voice Assisted Smart Home application with Alexa Voice Service Integration for AWS IoT (AFI). To learn more about the hardware specifications, please visit the [M5Stack Docs](https://docs.m5stack.com/#/en/core/core2_for_aws) or [Partner Device Catalog](https://devices.amazonaws.com/detail/a3G0h000007djMLEAY).
