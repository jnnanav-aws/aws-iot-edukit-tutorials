Welcome to the first AWS IoT EduKit tutorial. To complete this exercise, you need the [M5Stack Core2 ESP32 IoT Development Kit for AWS](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08VGRZYJR/) reference hardware. This tutorial walks you through a smart home solution to control some of the onboard peripherals. To accomplish this, you use can use RainMaker's smartphone application (through iOS or Android), or their command line interface (CLI). This tutorial does not require an AWS account and is indended to provide a quick demonstration of an embedded application that is enriched by connectivity to AWS IoT.

The solution you create uses the Espressif RainMaker platform, which is powered by AWS, to provide a customizable smart home application without managing the infrastructure. There is no additional cost to using Espressif's RainMaker Platform.

To begin this tutorial, continue to [**Setup Your Environment**](/en/getting-started/prerequisites.html).
